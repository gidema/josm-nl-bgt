This is an experimental plug-in that provides access to the BGT data in the Netherlands.

The BGT (Basisregistratie grootschalige Topografie or Key register Large-scale Topography) is a digital map of the Netherlands, which records buildings, roads, waterways, land, and railway lines in a uniform way. The map is accurate up to 20 centimeters and contains many details, just as you would see in reality. In short, it documents the spatial organization of our physical surroundings: trees, roads, buildings.

Please use this plug-in with care.
